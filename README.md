# texcommon
Provides common files for latex projects.  Add this as a submodule for use within a git-managed latex project.

The `bst/` directory contains `bibliographystyle` files that emulate the physrev, elsevier citation styles and also support an ePrint field. physrev and elsevier should automatically abbreviate long author lists and add in collaboration information.
