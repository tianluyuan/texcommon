However, recent observations of both Jupiter and Saturn have revealed surface features with periods close to those derived for the interiors. In the study reported here, this process is carried one stage further, with the derivation of a rotation rate for the spot associated with Satum's polar hexagon, which is simultaneously within and more accurate than the Saturnian radio period.},

abstract ={The hexagonal, pole-centered cloud feature in Saturn's northern atmosphere, as revealed in Voyager close-encounter imaging mosaics, may be interpreted as a stationary Rossby wave. The wave is embedded within a sharply peaked eastward jet (of 100 meters per second) and appears to be perturbed by at least one anticyclonic oval vortex immediately to the south. The effectively exact observational determination of the horizontal wave number and phase speed, applied to a simple model dispersion relation, suggests that the wave is vertically trapped and provides a diagnostic template for further modeling of the deep atmospheric stratification.},

abstract ={Polar projections of 50 images of Saturn at 889 nanometers and 25 images at 718 nanometers taken by the Hubble Space Telescope in November 1990, as well as 3 images at each wavelength taken in June 1991, have been examined. Among them, 31 show the north polar spot, which is associated with Saturn's polar hexagon, in locations suitable for measurement. In each image, planetocentric coordinates of the polar spot were determined, and the movement of the spot with respect to Saturn's system III rotation rate was studied. During the period of observation, the polar spot had first a short-term westward movement and then a long-term eastward drift. The rate of the long-term drift was –0.060 ± 0.008 degrees per day with respect to system III, approximately 50 percent greater than previously determined from Voyager. The original 1980 and 1981 Voyager data were combined with the new Hubble images to form an 11-year base line. The eastward drift over the longer period was –0.0569 degrees per day. The long-term drift could be due to uncertainty in the standard value of the internal rotation period, which is 810.7939 ± 0.148 degrees per 24-hour day. The short-term movement in November 1990 has a rate that is greater in magnitude but opposite in sign and probably represents a real, transient motion of the spot relative to the internal rotation system.},

The cores of both vortices are depleted in phosphine gas, probably resulting from subsidence of air into the troposphere. The warm cores are present throughout the upper troposphere and stratosphere at both poles. The thermal structure associated with the marked hexagonal polar jet at 77°N has been observed for the first time. Both the warm cyclonic belt at 79°N and the cold anticyclonic zone at 75°N exhibit the hexagonal structure.},

abstract ={Ground-based observations of two conspicuous features near the north pole of Saturn, the polar vortex and the hexagonal wave structure, were made from July 1990 to October 1991, 10 years after their discovery. During this period the polar spot drifted in longitude, relative to system III, by –0.0353° per day on average. Superimposed on this mean motion, the spot also underwent short-term rapid excursions in longitude of up to ∼14° at rates of up to ∼1° per day. The spot also exhibited irregular variations in its latitude location. A combination of these data together with those obtained by Voyager 1 and 2 in 1980 and 1981 shows that the spot drifted –0.0577° per day for the 11-year interval from 1980 to 1991. The large lifetime of both features indicates that they are insensitive to the strong variations in the seasonal heating of the cloud layers in the upper polar atmosphere.},

abstract = {{This is an attempt to describe all existing data on neutrino production of single pions in the resonance region up to W = 2 GeV in terms of the relativistic quark model of Feynman, Kislinger and Ravndal (FKR). We considered single pion production to be mediated by all interfering resonances below 2 GeV. A simple noninterfering, nonresonant background of isospin 12 was added. It improved agreement with experiment, particularly in the ratio of isospin amplitudes in charged current reactions, at the expense of one additional constant. All total cross sections, cross section ratios and W-distributions are well reproduced at low and high energies, with charged and neutral currents (supposing the Salam-Weinberg theory with sin2 θw ≈ 14 to be correct), and for neutrinos and antineutrinos, giving predictions where data are lacking. New predictions have been made for complex angular distributions in Nπ channels exhibiting strong interference between neighbouring resonances. These are sensitive (for 1.1 GeV ≲ W ≲ 1.5 GeV) to the sign of the Roper resonance P11(1450) which is controversial in photoproduction experiments.}}

Such measurements have not been updated for decades, having first been measured in bubble and spark chamber experiments. New measurements are sorely needed and yield important constraints for present and future neutrino oscillation experiments operating in this few-GeV energy range.

The goal of the project is to develop a ‘canonical’ neutrino interaction physics Monte Carlo whose validity extends to all nuclear targets and neutrino flavors from MeV to PeV energy scales. Currently, emphasis is on the few-GeV energy range, the challenging boundary between the non-perturbative and perturbative regimes, which is relevant for the current and near future long-baseline precision neutrino experiments using accelerator-made beams. The design of the package addresses many challenges unique to neutrino simulations and supports the full life-cycle of simulation and generator-related analysis tasks. \{GENIE\} is a large-scale software system, consisting of ∼ 120 000 lines of C ++ code, featuring a modern object-oriented design and extensively validated physics content. The first official physics release of \{GENIE\} was made available in August 2007, and at the time of the writing of this article, the latest available version was v2.4.4. "

Its main goal is to measure the last unknown lepton sector mixing angle θ 13 by observing ν e appearance in a ν μ beam. It also aims to make a precision measurement of the known oscillation parameters, Δ m 23 2 and sin 2 2 θ 23 , via ν μ disappearance studies. Other goals of the experiment include various neutrino cross-section measurements and sterile neutrino searches. The experiment uses an intense proton beam generated by the J-PARC accelerator in Tokai, Japan, and is composed of a neutrino beamline, a near detector complex (ND280), and a far detector (Super-Kamiokande) located 295km away from J-PARC. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the instrumentation aspect of the \{T2K\} experiment and a summary of the vital information for each subsystem. "

abstract = "The \{T2K\} experiment is designed to study neutrino oscillation properties by directing a high intensity neutrino beam produced at J-PARC in Tokai, Japan, towards the large Super-Kamiokande detector located 295&km away, in Kamioka, Japan. The experiment includes a sophisticated near detector complex, 280m downstream of the neutrino production target in order to measure the properties of the neutrino beam and to better understand neutrino interactions at the energy scale below a few GeV. A key element of the near detectors is the \{ND280\} tracker, consisting of two active scintillator–bar target systems surrounded by three large time projection chambers (TPCs) for charged particle tracking. The data collected with the tracker are used to study charged current neutrino interaction rates and kinematics prior to oscillation, in order to reduce uncertainties in the oscillation measurements by the far detector. The tracker is surrounded by the former UA1/NOMAD dipole magnet and the \{TPCs\} measure the charges, momenta, and particle types of charged particles passing through them. Novel features of the \{TPC\} design include its rectangular box layout constructed from composite panels, the use of bulk micromegas detectors for gas amplification, electronics readout based on a new ASIC, and a photoelectron calibration system. This paper describes the design and construction of the TPCs, the micromegas modules, the readout electronics, the gas handling system, and shows the performance of the \{TPCs\} as deduced from measurements with particle beams, cosmic rays, and the calibration system.

The beam is produced at the J-PARC accelerator complex in Tokai, Japan, and the neutrinos are detected by the Super-Kamiokande detector located 295km away in Kamioka. A suite of near detectors (ND280) located 280 m downstream of the production target is used to characterize the components of the beam before they have had a chance to oscillate and to better understand various neutrino interactions on several nuclei. This paper describes the design and construction of two massive fine-grained detectors (FGDs) that serve as active targets in the \{ND280\} tracker. One \{FGD\} is composed solely of scintillator bars while the other is partly scintillator and partly water. Each element of the \{FGDs\} is described, including the wavelength shifting fiber and Multi-Pixel Photon Counter used to collect the light signals, the readout electronics, and the calibration system. Initial tests and in situ results of the FGDs' performance are also presented. "
